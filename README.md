# Json-Transformation
### Json-transformation is a project with the help of which we can convert one Json structured file to the other Json structured file. 
### It can also used to generate the code to convert one json structured file to some other json structure.


We developer have to use a lot of **APIs** and we usually get a *Json* file back/ We spend a lot of time with the json files for our diffrent projects . But in allmost all the cases we never get the **Json file Structed the way we want**.

There are libraries available to convert one json file to other such as JQ, JSONATA, JOLT but *they are not as straight forward as this project*. To use those libraries we need to go through their long documentations and know how to use them. Even after reading the documentation *we have to spend a good amount of time to write a code to convert one json structured file to the desired json structure.* 

Therefore to *reduce the time and effort* we usually spend reading the documentation and write the required code, Json-Transformation took care of all of that by itself. **We just need to tell/write what to do and Json-transformation will** ***generate the required code, excute it*** **and will give us the json file structured the way we want**.

If we just want *to get the simple javascript code to convert one json structured file to other json structured file* but not the converted json then we just *have to make a call to its api only*.
